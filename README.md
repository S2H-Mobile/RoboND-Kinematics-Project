# RoboND-Kinematics-Project
A solution for inverse kinematics of KUKA KR210.

- [IK_server.py](https://github.com/S2H-Mobile/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/blob/master/IK_server.py) is the python module that solves the inverse kinematics problem posed in the project.
- [kinematics_test.ipynb](https://github.com/S2H-Mobile/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/blob/master/kinematics_test.ipynb) is a Jupyter notebook for testing the forward and inverse kinematics.
- [writeup/writeup_pick_and_place.md](https://github.com/S2H-Mobile/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/blob/master/writeup/writeup_pick_and_place.md) describes the solution strategy.
- [writeup/kinematics.pdf](https://github.com/S2H-Mobile/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/blob/master/writeup/kinematics.pdf) provides additional background in geometry and further aspects of the KR210 arm design.


## Setup and Usage 
1. Follow the setup instructions of the [Udacity Kinematics project](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project).
2. Replace [IK_server.py](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/blob/master/kuka_arm/scripts/IK_server.py) by the one provided [here](https://github.com/S2H-Mobile/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/blob/master/IK_server.py).
3. Follow the instructions of the [Udacity Kinematics project](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project) to run the simulation.
